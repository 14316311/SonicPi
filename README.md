# SonicPi
INTRODUCTION: 
This project is a music track created by coding via the platform Sonic Pi. In the Git Repo there are 3 different file types. The aim of this project was to develop my skills in code and data literacy.  I combined my love for music and music composition to encourage motivation, creativity and attention to detail. Through this, I  have successfully composed a song using the platform Sonic Pi, that incorporates writing computer code and programming to create sounds and music. I have then furthered my project by transferring that data to a digital audio workstation. Additionally, I recorded, arranged and mixed the tracks I created by coding through SonicPi and recorded vocals to create a mp4/m4a music track. 


RUBY FILES
The Ruby files are the code files that I wrote and created using SonicPi. Each Ruby file is a different 'section' of the song and has different codes written in it to 

WAV FILES
The WAV files are recorded sound files of the sounds that were created through coding on SonicPi. These are all seperate files.

M4A FILE
The M4a is the final track where I combined the recorded wav files and mixed them in a DAW(Digital Audio Workstation) and recorded vocals over the top. I wanted to create an mp3/mp4 track however the m4a track is similar and is better quality and easier to download and upload.

Enjoy :)
