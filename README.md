# SonicPi
INTRODUCTION: 
This project is a music track created by coding via the platform Sonic Pi. In the Git Repo there are 3 different file types. The aim of this project was to develop my skills in code and data literacy.  I combined my love for music and music composition to encourage motivation, creativity and attention to detail. Through this, I  have successfully composed a song using the platform Sonic Pi, that incorporates writing computer code and programming to create sounds and music. I have then furthered my project by transferring that data to a digital audio workstation. Additionally, I recorded, arranged and mixed the tracks I created by coding through SonicPi and recorded vocals to create a mp4/m4a music track. 


RUBY FILES:
Code_1.rb ,
Code_2.rb ,
Code_3.rb ,
Code_4.rb ,
Code_5.rb ,
Code_6.rb ,
Code_7.rb ,
Code_8.rb ,
SonicPi_code.rb

The Ruby files are the code files that I wrote and created using SonicPi. Each Ruby file is a different 'section' of the song and has different codes written in it to 

WAV FILES:
SonicPi_P1.wav ,
SonicPi_P2.wav ,
SonicPi_P3.wav ,
SonicPi_P4.wav ,
SonicPi_P5.wav ,

The WAV files are recorded sound files of the sounds that were created through coding on SonicPi. These are all seperate files.

M4A FILE
FINAL MP3 TRACK WITH AUDIO - WHITE NOISE.m4a ,
Project Sonic pi - 21_10_22, 3.03 pm.m4a

The M4a files are final track where I combined the recorded wav files and mixed them in a DAW(Digital Audio Workstation) and recorded vocals over the top. I wanted to create an mp3/mp4 track however the m4a track essentially creates the same purpose, of playing the track digitally. Please download and listen by pressing 'see raw'.

Enjoy :)
